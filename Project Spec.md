## App Overview

### Description 

Allows anyone to look up a region and see impact of activities within that region on the environment. Allows users to also calculate their own carbon footprint and see how they're impacting the environment and climate. App can make suggestions about how users can lessen their carbon footprint and users can use the app later to see if how they're changes have affected their carbon footprint calculation

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Mobile:** The mobile format would allow people to access this application easier than a website. You can input your transportation method while on the go. A stretch feature would be saving your annual emissions so you can see your data across weeks, months, years. 
- **Story:** In terms of clarity, the number of CO2e emissions may be abstract to the average user. It is possible that we need to break down CO2e score so the average user can understand the impact of their actions on a greater scale. People who use this app will be conscious of their impact on the enviroment, so it will be important to help users understand. For example, "Your activities used a total of ___ CO2e. That's the equivalent of a computer running all day!"
- **Market:** While it does not provide a service (like Uber) or alleviate an inconvenience (like Amazon), it addresses a niche but growing audience. Potential user base would depend on the amount of people who are interested in preventing climate change. As more people are interested in going green (like how many are switching to electric vehicles) we predict that more and more people will use it. 
- **Habit:** Could be very habit forming depending on individual interest in climate change. Especially with teams/social feature, but otherwise may only be an app used every so often. 
- **Scope:** The challenging part will be making the drop down menu. A stretch feature would revolve around allowing the user to conduct a search and the amount of text fields. Given the amount of activities the user can look up, it may difficult to let the user know what activities users can log. And even if users do log in data, there may be additional fields they have to fill out, like what country or state are they located.
