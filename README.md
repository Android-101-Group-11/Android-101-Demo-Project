## Summary

This document provides a summary of our project building process for our app, **Carbonator**

Did you know the average American drives about 14,263* miles per year? This app helps users learn more about the quantity of carbon emissions from certain cars. The first page shows a view with the top 10 selling cars in the United States, if these cars were driven 15,000 miles annually. The second page allows users to calculate how much CO2e the user would emit if they were to personally drive one of those cars, by inputting how many miles they travel annually.

## Summary

This document provides an overview, project spec, and wireframes for our team's capstone project: 

**Carbonator is an app that allows anyone to look up a region and see the impact of activities within that region on the environment. Allows users to also calculate their own carbon footprint and see how theyâ€™re impacting the environment and climate. App can make suggestions about how users can lessen their carbon footprint and users can use the app later to see if how theyâ€™re changes have affected their carbon footprint calculation**
