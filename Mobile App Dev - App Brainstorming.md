## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate
### Discord/Slack
   - **Category:** Messaging 
   - **Mobile:** Can use on website, but apps are most prominent, even on computers. App easy to use, send messages, any content from the internet, can create servers and invite different people
   - **Story:** Users can share pretty much any kind of content on these apps. Can private message and create servers/organizations. Servers and organizations can be moderated. High value, as people always want to message one another and create group chats. 
   - **Market:** While discord and slack tend to be more casual vs professional, pretty much everyone wants to use a messaging app. These apps manage to have a plethora of features while keeping the ui and use of the app relatively simple for those who simply just want a platform to message others on. 
   - **Habit:** Very habit forming as users will want to message their friends and/or colleagues almost every day. 
   - **Scope:** Would be very challenging as there are many different kind of features and all sorts of content can be shared on these apps. Would need to figure out how the code works for sharing all different kinds of content. Would also need to figure out the backend for storing messages. 
### Eventbrite
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, events
   - **Mobile:** The main reason to use Eventbrite on your phone is the feature to add your tickets for events to the app. The UI, is pretty simple and user friendly, even seeming to use a recyler view to display events to the user in the first tab. The app makes suggestions based on user location, editor picks, personal preference as well (the types of events the user seems to be interested in), and popularity of events. The user can also save favorite events and see them in the favorites tab. While has a simple UI and is easy to use, the main reason for using the app instead of going to the website is the feature for mobile tickets. Can also see many users searching for events on a computer, adding them, then having ticekts available on phone so Eventbrite probably works best with both the site and the app.
   - **Market:** The market for this app is highly competitive as there are many event type apps similar to Eventbrite. Despite that, Eventbrite remains well known and even comes up as the first suggestion for events on the ios app store. The audience for this app is a wide variety of people who may be looking for the next big event to go to or an event to go to in their city.
   - **Habit:** The seems like an app that would only be opened every so often. The user will only open the app to possibly search for new events to go to or to access their tickets when they go to an event. After an event is booked, it's unlikely that the user will be opening the app everyday, unless they're searching for many things to do that year. Even then, it seems better to search for and add events to a user's schedule on the site. Alhough the app has a nice UI, it is a bit cluttered as there is a lot of information for each event.
   - **Scope:** An app like this would be challenging to build as it has to constantly be updated or be connected to something like a constantly updated api, if something like that is even feasible. Otherwise, programmers and the company have to stay up to events every single day, in order to make sure that users have access to the most popular and up to date upcoming events.
### Google maps
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, productivity, travel
   - **Mobile:** As a navigation app, the usage of google maps is primarily mobile because of convenience, location tracking, being able to give real time directions, and also additional features such as arrival time, offline mode, and even using the search bar to find places near you based on what the user wants and proximity. While the google maps site is effective for planning, the usage does remain primarily on the app as it can effectively serve as a guide for the user during their travels and adjust if the user goes in the wrong direction or makes a wrong turn. The voice feature is also very helpful for the user while driving, serving as a guide for the driver. 
   - **Story:** As a mainline google product, the app has known to be something that has effectively changed society and the world at large. Before google maps and smartphones, individuals either had to use maps, devices specifically dedicated to gps navigation, memorize directions, or plan out directions beforehand with something like mapquest. Google maps and similar gps apps, have effectively rendered those types of tools and technologies obselete. 
   - **Market:** The audience for this app remains quite large. It is essentially any individual with a smartphone whose trying to get to somewhere and isn't sure about the directions to get there. It's competition is also quite steep with apps like waze or apple maps. For the most part these apps all perform to about the same level of functional quality, so deciding which gps app to use is mostly based on user preference. 
   - **Habit:** This app can be quite habit forming as the user needs it whenver they might be traveling or going somehwhere they haven't been to before. After a while app usage may lessen if the user can remember the directions or how to get to those places on their own. If the user however, is traveling often or going to unkown places they may be using this app quite often.
   - **Scope:** An app like this is mostly difficult to build because of the api or database it connects to. The database or api has to store thousands upon thousands of information about addresses, locations, restauraunts, venues, shopping centers, etc and has to be constantly updated to also be effective. Google even has pictures of addresses as well, so while also having to be a massive amount of work to photograph each area, along with getting permission to do so, those photographs areas, change in restaurants venues, have to be changed often enough for the data and the app to be relevant to the user. 
### Yelp
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, productivity, travel, social, entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Yelp works pretty well on both the site and the app. The main reason a user might use the app over the site however, is when they're out already and not sure where to go, or looking for another place to go to. 
   - **Story:** Yelp is a great app that helps many people myself included, find new places to go to and eat, especially. This app is great mostly because of the social and rating feature. For myself personally, I will usually filter places by highest rated or most reviewed, as I generally feel that gets better results for me, but the social feature really helps widen the audience of the app.
   - **Market:** The audience of this app is anyone with a smartphone, as it targets anyone who is looking for new places to try and go to in their area or other areas as well. It helps that yelp has included pretty much any aspect of buisness, rather than just food. So even if someone is looking for a new dentist, there is probably a yelp review if that place is popular enough. 
   - **Habit:** Reading and writing reviews can be a time sink in itself, but in general this app should mainly be used when individuals are trying to make plans or when they may be out already. In that case, the habit forming of using yelp should be maybe a few times a week at most. 
   - **Scope:** This app seems like a challenge to build due to its database. As it is mostly based on users leaving reviews, I imagine that those reviews have to be stored somewhere. The database and/or api also has to update often to include new buisnesses and all of this data has to be stored somewhere. 
### Spotify
   - **Category:** Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** There is a web player for spotify, but it is mainly just the app on the web. The main usage for the web player might be if someone doesn't have the spotify app downloaded on their computer. However, the app is mainly used over the web player, as individuals may want to play music wherever they go, while driving or taking the bus, at the gym, and other places as well. 
   - **Story:** Most everyone wants to listen to music and spotify has just about every song from popular culture most individuals can think of and the other subgenres upon subgenres that music categories encompass. With the rise of spotify, it has made technology like cd's almost completely obselete, as it makes sense to pay a subscription fee to have access to thousands upon thousands of songs, that can be played from just about anywhere. If not, you can probably find most of your music in some form another, online and in a digital format. 
   - **Market:** While I do think spotify is the main music streaming service platform for most people, music is a big field with many different genres and types of music. For people whose music taste may be very different from the norm, spotify may not have it, but it has most of the music most people listen to. Spotify also streams many podcasts, however, which also greatly broadens its audience. 
   - **Habit:** The habit forming around this app, mostly depends on the users interest in listening to music and free time, but for me personally I use spotify almost everyday. This is in part due to the many features of spotify as well, such as recommending new music based on what you're listening to, creating weekly mixtapes for the user, the ability to add friends and see what they're listening to, a driving mode, being able to listen to music offline, among others. 
   - **Scope:** This app also seems like a challenge because of its massive database. Spotify has thousands and thousands of songs which seem to be getting updated daily. There is also the aspect of the copyright laws around these songs and getting access to use them on your app.
### Google Calendar
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, productivity
   - **Mobile:** The app tends to go get used more than websitee in general, as it most people will usually have their phone on them, but may not have access to a laptop or pc at any given moment. This is another case where the website and calendar work best together. The main advantage of using it on the web is that it is a bit easier to see the different features and options and also setting up events. However, the reminders on a phone device are incredibly helpful and setting up events is still good on the app as well.
   - **Story:** Google calendar is just an very effective time management app. I find myself usually gravitating towards it, rather than the pre-installed ios calendar app, as it just tends to have more features such as syncing with other calendars, adding the calendars of friends and families, setting reminders that are imprecise and precise as you want them to be, and even sycing with the pre-installed ios calendar as well and being accessible over the web as well. 
   - **Market:** Google calendar is aimed at anyone who is trying to increase their productivity and have a reliable tool for time management. I do think that most people who use google calendar do tend to be of the younger generation however.
   - **Habit:** As a time management app, it creates habit forming to be used everyday. Especially with some users, who seem to want to schedule almost every hour of their days. For me personally, I use it to keep up with my classes, deadlines, work schedule. For that reason, I see the habit forming of this app to be almost everyday.
   - **Scope:** This app seems like a challenge to build as you have to store the user data somewhere. This could be as little or as much as possible depending on the user and this app has to account for that. Google calendar also has many features and syncs with other calendars as well, which might be challenging to build.
### Mail app (ios)
   - **Category: Lifestyle, productivity
   - **Mobile:** This is another case where both the web and app work best together. Of course the main upside to using is the app, is that you always have access to email and can send and recieve email from anywhere or anytime. Especially, if you are expecting an important email, this is especially vital. Most of the time you will always have your phone on you as well, but again my not have accesss to a laptop or pc. This can be a bit unstable however, depending on your cellular service or what wifi your device is connected to. Writing out emails, espeically professional ones are also always better with a keyboard than a phone.
   - **Story:** The fact that you can send and recieve emails anytime or anywhere is great and not so great at the same time. For instance, lets say I was at Disneyland with family, enjoying the day. That day however, I was expecting an important email, where speed is of the essence so I could reply as quickly as possible. So, in this way this is great that I can reply as soon as possible. On the other hand, if I didn't have the ability to check my email whenever possible, I probably wouldn't worry so much and would enjoy my day. If the the circumstances around technology were different as well, I probably wouldn't be expected to reply as soon as possible as well. 
   - **Market:** As letters are a rare sight these days, email apps are geared to most working professionals and students. Email has become a prominent form of communication and for me personally, I use email for almost all professional correspondence. To use most sites, an app, or even a smartphone you typically need an email as well, so if you're using a smartphone you have an email. 
   - **Habit:** For most people, corespondence through work or school happens through email. This is an app most people use everyday to check email or reply to email. 
   - **Scope:** Once again this app is mainly challenging to due to the database and having store probably millions of emails from many different users. 
### YouTube
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, productivity, entertainment
   - **Mobile:** Here, usage also tends to lean on the mobile side, mostly due to the portability and compactness of a smart phone. The youtube app as a clean, simple layout that also seems to use a recyler view to display suggested videos on the home page. The app is sleek and responsive with videos starting on touch and can be displayed horizontally for a wider video display for the user.
   - **Story:** YouTube has been on the rise since the early 2000s and while it has seen its share of falls and declines, it still remains one of the top contenders for a video sharing streaming platform, with it's competition probably being twitch and tiktok, but those platforms provide more specific content (gaming and short videos).
   - **Market:** I think that youtube does remain the main streaming video platform. The content of sites like twitch or tiktok or are just more specific and tend to be aimed at younger audiences. Youtube being the main streaming video platform is further exemplefied that youtube will have uploaded videos of twitch streams or tiktok videos on its site. So in that regard, youtube is aimed at pretty much everyone and is used by almost everyone who has a smartphone, but there may be users who just prefer to use other video streaming sites depending on the type of content they want to consume. 
   - **Habit:** While there is a lot of educational content on youtube, in general most users go to the site itself for entertainment. In classes or while learning if there is a link to a video, it is probably a youtube video. I also don't think the content hosted on youtube tends to be addicting as twitch or tiktok these days, so I would say habit forming around usage is probably every other day or a few days a week for most users. 
   - **Scope:** Youtube seems like another challenge because of the database as well. There must be an incredible backend system for the users accounts, hosting videos, and deleting videos. Not to mention the youtube algorithm that recommends and suggests videos for you as well. 
### Banking(Wells Fargo)
   - **Category:** Finance, Lifestyle, productivity
   - **Mobile:** Once again mobile here wins out due to the compactness and portability of a phone. The ability to make quick checks on your back account, send money, make transfers and even use your phone camera to deposit checks, along with many other features helps to greatly increase the app usage as opposed to the website. 
   - **Story:** The Wells Fargo app, has seen gradual, small improvements over the years that really make it now one of my most used apps. With digital transfers being so easy, direct deposits and sending money very easy as well with Zelle, it has become my main way of handling finances rather than in person banking. 
   - **Market:** The audience for this app is for any individual who has an account with wells fargo. As wells fargo is my main point of reference, I can't speak to the quality of other banking apps, but I do think wells fargo has declined in popularity over the years and is not the most popular bank.
   - **Habit:** For most users, I would think they have to check on their finances everyday. For this reason, the habit forming for usage of this app is everyday for most users. 
   - **Scope:** This app mainly seems challenging as it directly connects to the money of the user. There has to some sort of system that happens as a user transfers money, sends money, uses their credit card, etc. 


## New App Ideas / Initial Brainstorming ideas - List
1. Carboon Footprint Tracker
   - Allows anyone to search up activities and see it's impact on the environment. Users can calculate their carbon footprint and see how they're impacting the environment. App makes suggestions on what they can do to lessen carbon footprint, users can use the app later to see how they have lessened their carbon footprint. Possibly add teams/social feature where users can compete against friends and other organizations to get "lowest" carbon footprint score to increase habit forming.
3. Yelp duplicate 
    - Would be similar to yelp in that it allows users to leave ratings and reviews for buisnesses. Would have to be able to let users search through buisnesses and filer their search. When the user clicks on a page they would see the buisness information, hours of operation, etc. 
4. Event tracker(similar to eventbrite)
    - Allows users to enter their zipcode to see events happening near them. Images populate the screen, possibly in a recyler view with small descirptions and the event tile. On click users are taken to the event page. Have multiple tabs that includes a ticket tap where users can show and use their digital ticket.
5. Activities to do if you're bored using Bored API
    - Has a button that allows users to click which will generate random activities the user can do. Has search bar where user can type a category and app generates activities that much the type of what the user input. Possible social feature where users can suggest activities to their friends and see what activities their friends are doing.
6. Gmail duplicate 
    - Simple gmail duplicate app that allows users to recieve and reply to, and send email.
7. Weather app
    - Weather app that shows the local forecast of the area that you reside. Has forecast for upcoming week and times of the day. Can input different locations and see the weather for different areas.
8. Reddit clone
    - Reddit clone that allows users to make threads and respond to other users
9. Health app 
    - App that alows users to input calories for each meal they eat and exercise they did for the day. App provides calculation for user based on caloric intake if they are over or not. Possible goal setting where app helps them keep track of progress towards health/fitness goal. Possible social feature to check on friends/family, encourage one another make teams, "compete" against other users


## Top 3 New App Ideas
1. Carbon Footprint Tracker 
2. Yelp Duplicate
3. Event Tracker

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Carbon Footprint Tracker
   - **Description**: Allows anyone to look up a region and see impact of activities within that region on the environment. Allows users to also calculate their own carbon footprint and see how they're impacting the environment and climate. App can make suggestions about how users can lessen their carbon footprint and users can use the app later to see if how they're changes have affected their carbon footprint calculation
   - **Category:** Environmental/ Social Awareness
   - **Mobile:** Possibly add some sort of team feature where you can track carbon footprint together. Compete against each other to get the "lowest" score/ calculate carbon footprint as whole, rank scores vs other organizations, try to get the "lowest"
   - **Story:** Very prevalent as the environment and climate change is currently a big issue. Could be useful as not everyone is aware how they're activities are impacting the environment.
   - **Market:** Any individual or group of individuals could be interested in the app, as the environment is impacting all of us. 
   - **Habit:** Could be very habit forming depending on individual interest in climate change. Especially with teams/social feature, but otherwise may only be an app used every so often. 
   - **Scope:** This app could be challenging as there are many features to work on. Even without the teams feature this could still be an interesting app that calls on the climateiq api.
2. Yelp Duplicate
   - **Description**: A yelp duplicate that allows users to look up buisnesses, leave reviews, check out buisness page, respond to other users, filter search based on own prefrences 
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, Productivity, Entertainment
   - **Mobile:** The main appeal as a mobile app is that users may not have plans clearly defined before they go out or may want to go to another buisness while at somehwere. While out they can look at other buisnesses and reviews. 
   - **Story:** This helps users help other users, as through their written reviews, they can make suggestions to other users about how they think the buisness can improve and it also hleps the buisness as well.
   - **Market:** This would be aimed at any adult with a smartphone looking for well reviewed places to try and go out to. Could possibly also be applied to dentists, doctors, etc.
   - **Habit:** This could be highly habit forming depending on the user. If the use is looking for new places to try or is in an unfamiliar area the user may be using the app often. 
   - **Scope:** This main challenge of building this app would be building a database or calling on an api that stores the data of different buisnesses. Would also need to store reviews of users in database and replies between users. 
3. EventTracker
    - **Description**: Allows users to input their zipcode to see events happening around in the area. A feed of nearby events will populate the screen and users can click on images and links that will take them to the event. 
    - **Mobile:** Users can look up the information while on the go. Users most likely will have their phones with them when they are traveling with friends, and this app will allow them to easily reference events.
   - **Story:** The value of this app is quite clear. People often travel and need to have things to do. Our friends and peers would find something like this useful during the summer or winter breaks, when people are free to travel.
   - **Market:** The market of this app would be large, depending on the season. The audience would be traveling familes, students, couples. The app wouldn't provide a niche value, rather it would have appear to a lot of people because it provides a service and lessens the inconvenience of looking up the data online. 
   - **Habit:** The app wouldn't be addictive on its own, as the user would only open it when they are traveling or planning a vacation. The average user would mostly use it to gain information and plan events.
   - **Scope:** The scope of this app looks pretty simple, but it will depend on how easily it is to use / call the event brite API. While the idea may not be as interesting as the carbonfootprint idea, it may be easier to implement. 



## Final App idea: Carbon Footprint  Tracker
